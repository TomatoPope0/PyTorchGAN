# Pytorch Implementation of Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN)

This is my take on the implementation of GAN [1], using Pytorch [2]. I used MNIST [3] for training and testing.

As I'm an active learning student, this implementation may not be complete or accurate. Therefore, I recommend you to use other reliable implementations if you're willing to use it in your project.

If you find any bugs or flaws, please let me know. Also, I tried using the IEEE style citation, just for practicing. If you think any of the citations are improper, please let me know.
